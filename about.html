			<p>I've worked as an administrative professional and in customer service for a long time, but to be honest I was bored.  
			While I love problem solving (a big part of customer service), I wasn't being challenged enough or using my creativity.  
			I had heard programming would fulfill all three of these career goals, so I went back to school and I recently graduated 
			with an AAS in Programming.  I absolutely love it and I am looking forward to the next step in my career.</p>
